# Google-Sninipet-Auditing
This is a piece of code implemented in the project auditing the partisanship of Google Search Snippets to parse the crawled html and compute the bias score. The paper documenting this project is recently accepted by the 2019 Web Conference (WWW 2019), a more detailed set of code and data will be released later.
